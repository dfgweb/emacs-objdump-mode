emacs-objdump-mode
==================

The objdump.el code here provides some simple support for
disassembling an executable or object file with GNU objdump and
browsing the result. (The "disassemble" command in Emacs is already
used for examining byte code.)

There are only a couple of interesting key bindings: "g" will re-run
the objdump command in case you've recompiled, and "s" will prompt for
a symbolic address, which can be of the forms "foo" or "foo+0x1234"
(the latter being common syntax in stack traces generated by the Linux
kernel), compute the actual hexadecimal address, and search for it in
the dump.

You can run "objdump -drl foo.o" yourself and save the results in a
text file with the initial line "-*- objdump -*-"; in that case, the
"s" binding above will work, but "g" won't.

Oh, and if you run M-x objdump, it'll prompt for a file name, but will
override completion-ignored-extensions so you can complete on .o files
and such even if you can't normally.
